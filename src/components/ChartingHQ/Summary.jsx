              Provenance set out to build a company that reimagines the way people think about community, connection, and meaning, starting with how they celebrate major life milestones. With the initial entry wedge being weddings, they were looking to come out of stealth and launch their MVP to the market, and they also needed a marketing website to accompany it.

              As a Product Designer, I built Provenance's MVP from scratch â€“ I took the web app through all stages of the UX design process and got it ready for launch. I then designed and built a highly effective Webflow website that educates visitors about Provenance's offering and converts them into users and customers. Over the next two years, I worked on countless iterations of their existing offering, and also helped them launch a few new apps.
